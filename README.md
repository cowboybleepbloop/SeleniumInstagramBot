# Selenium-Instagram-Bot
An Instagram bot to like and comment on a set number of posts

# Description

I created this to use with the Instagram account that I run for my Etsy store. I wanted to assess whether or not liking and commenting on posts would drive more engagement with my own account.

Using Selenium browser automation, the program will take a username and password and login to a chosen Instgram account. The program can then perform a search of any chosen keyword, select the first post associated with that keyword, like the post, comment on the post with any comment the user inputs, scroll to the next post, and repeat the process for any number of posts the user sets.

As a disclaimer, Instagram will recognize this as a bot and may limit the account's interaction with posts. I'm not familiar enough with the Instagram TOS to know if this could get an account removed from the platform. Use with caution.
